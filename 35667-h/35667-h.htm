<h2>A CELEBRATION</h2>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>A middle-northern March, now as always&mdash;<br />
gusts from the south broken against cold winds&mdash;<br />
but from under, as if a slow hand lifted a tide,<br />
it moves&mdash;not into April&mdash;into a second March,<br />
the old skin of wind-clear scales dropping<br />
upon the mould: this is the shadow projects the tree<br />
upward causing the sun to shine in his sphere.<br />
<br />
So we will put on our pink felt hat&mdash;new last year!<br />
&mdash;newer this by virtue of brown eyes turning back<br />
the seasons&mdash;and let us walk to the orchid-house,<br />
see the flowers will take the prize to-morrow<br />
at the Palace.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Stop here, these are our oleanders.</span><br />
When they are in bloom&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">You would waste words</span><br />
It is clearer to me than if the pink<br />
were on the branch. It would be a searching in<br />
a coloured cloud to reveal that which now, huskless,<br />
shows the very reason for their being.<br />
<br />
And these the orange-trees, in blossom&mdash;no need<br />
to tell with this weight of perfume in the air.<br />
If it were not so dark in this shed one could better<br />
see the white.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">It is that very perfume</span><br />
has drawn the darkness down among the leaves.<br />
Do I speak clearly enough?<br />
It is this darkness reveals that which darkness alone<br />
loosens and sets spinning on waxen wings&mdash;<br />
not the touch of a finger-tip, not the motion<br />
of a sigh. A too heavy sweetness proves<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>its own caretaker.<br />
And here are the orchids!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Never having seen</span><br />
such gaiety I will read these flowers for you:<br />
This is an odd January, died&mdash;in Villon&#8217;s time.<br />
Snow, this is and this the stain of a violet<br />
grew in that place the spring that foresaw its own doom.<br />
<br />
And this, a certain July from Iceland:<br />
a young woman of that place<br />
breathed it toward the south. It took root there.<br />
The colour ran true but the plant is small.<br />
<br />
This falling spray of snowflakes is<br />
a handful of dead Februarys<br />
prayed into flower by Rafael Arevalo Martinez<br />
of Guatemala.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Here&#8217;s that old friend who</span><br />
went by my side so many years: this full, fragile<br />
head of veined lavender. Oh that April<br />
that we first went with our stiff lusts<br />
leaving the city behind, out to the green hill&mdash;<br />
May, they said she was. A hand for all of us:<br />
this branch of blue butterflies tied to this stem.<br />
<br />
June is a yellow cup I&#8217;ll not name; August<br />
the over-heavy one. And here are&mdash;<br />
russet and shiny, all but March. And March?<br />
Ah, March&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Flowers are a tiresome pastime.</span><br />
One has a wish to shake them from their pots<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>root and stern, for the sun to gnaw.<br />
<br />
Walk out again into the cold and saunter home<br />
to the fire. This day has blossomed long enough.<br />
I have wiped out the red night and lit a blaze<br />
instead which will at least warm our hands<br />
and stir up the talk.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">I think we have kept fair time.</span><br />
Time is a green orchid.</td></tr></table>

against him,<br />
too much of sumac buds, pink<br />
in the head<br />

too many opening hearts of<br />
lilac leaves,<br />
too many, too many swollen<br />
limp poplar tassels on the<br />
bare branches!<br />

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>Go to sleep&mdash;though of course you will not&mdash;<br />
to tideless waves thundering slantwise against<br />
strong embankments, rattle and swish of spray<br />
dashed thirty feet high, caught by the lake wind,<br />
scattered and strewn broadcast in over the steady<br />
car rails! Sleep, sleep! Gulls&#8217; cries in a wind-gust<br />
broken by the wind; calculating wings set above<br />
the field of waves breaking.<br />
Go to sleep to the lunge between foam-crests,<br />
refuse churned in the recoil. Food! Food!<br />
Offal! Offal! that holds them in the air, wave-white<br />
for the one purpose, feather upon feather, the wild<br />
chill in their eyes, the hoarseness in their voices&mdash;<br />
sleep, sleep....<br />
<br />
Gentlefooted crowds are treading out your lullaby.<br />
Their arms nudge, they brush shoulders,<br />
hitch this way then that, mass and surge at the crossings&mdash;<br />
lullaby, lullaby! The wild-fowl police whistles,<br />
the enraged roar of the traffic, machine shrieks:<br />
it is all to put you to sleep,<br />
to soften your limbs in relaxed postures,<br />
and that your head slip sidewise, and your hair loosen<br />
and fall over your eyes and over your mouth,<br />
brushing your lips wistfully that you may dream,<br />
sleep and dream&mdash;<br />
<br />
A black fungus springs out about lonely church doors&mdash;<br />
sleep, sleep. The Night, coming down upon<br />
the wet boulevard, would start you awake with his<br />
message, to have in at your window. Pay no<br />
heed to him. He storms at your sill with<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>cooings, with gesticulations, curses!<br />
You will not let him in. He would keep you from sleeping.<br />
He would have you sit under your desk lamp<br />
brooding, pondering; he would have you<br />
slide out the drawer, take up the ornamented dagger<br />
and handle it. It is late, it is nineteen-nineteen&mdash;<br />
go to sleep, his cries are a lullaby;<br />
his jabbering is a sleep-well-my-baby; he is<br />
a crackbrained messenger.<br />
<br />
The maid waking you in the morning<br />
when you are up and dressing,<br />
the rustle of your clothes as you raise them&mdash;<br />
it is the same tune.<br />
At table the cold, greenish, split grapefruit, its juice<br />
on the tongue, the clink of the spoon in<br />
your coffee, the toast odors say it over and over.<br />
<br />
The open street-door lets in the breath of<br />
the morning wind from over the lake.<br />
The bus coming to a halt grinds from its sullen brakes&mdash;<br />
lullaby, lullaby. The crackle of a newspaper,<br />
the movement of the troubled coat beside you&mdash;<br />
sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep....<br />
It is the sting of snow, the burning liquor of<br />
the moonlight, the rush of rain in the gutters packed<br />
with dead leaves: go to sleep, go to sleep.<br />

the spongy greens of a nature whose<br />
flickering mountain&mdash;bulging nearer,<br />
ebbing back into the sun<br />
hollowing itself away to hold a lake,&mdash;<br />
or brown stream rising and falling<br />
at the roadside, turning about,<br />

The stream continues its motion of<br />
a hound running over rough ground.<br />
<br />
Trees vanish&mdash;reappear&mdash;vanish:<br />
detached dance of gnomes&mdash;as a talk<br />
dodging remarks, glows and fades.<br />
&mdash;The unseen power of words&mdash;<br />
And now that a few of the moves<br />
are clear the first desire is<br />
to fling oneself out at the side into<br />
the other dance, to other music.<br />
Peer Gynt. Rip Van Winkle. Diana.<br />
<br />
If I were young I would try a new alignment&mdash;<br />
alight nimbly from the car, Good-bye!&mdash;<br />
Childhood companions linked two and two<br />
criss-cross: four, three, two, one.<br />
Back into self, tentacles withdrawn.<br />
Feel about in warm self-flesh.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Since childhood, since childhood!<br />
Childhood is a toad in the garden, a<br />
happy toad. All toads are happy<br />
and belong in gardens. A toad to Diana!<br />
<br />
Lean forward. Punch the steersman<br />
behind the ear. Twirl the wheel!<br />
Over the edge! Screams! Crash!<br />
The end. I sit above my head&mdash;<br />
a little removed&mdash;or<br />
a thin wash of rain on the roadway<br />
&mdash;I am never afraid when he is driving,&mdash;<br />
interposes new direction,<br />
rides us sidewise, unforseen<br />
into the ditch! All threads cut!<br />
Death! Black. The end. The very end&mdash;<br />
<br />
I would sit separate weighing a<br />
small red handful: the dirt of these parts,<br />
sliding mists sheeting the alders<br />
against the touch of fingers creeping<br />
to mine. All stuff of the blind emotions.<br />
But&mdash;stirred, the eye seizes<br />
for the first time&mdash;The eye awake!&mdash;<br />
anything, a dirt bank with green stars<br />
of scrawny weed flattened upon it under<br />
a weight of air&mdash;For the first time!&mdash;<br />
or a yawning depth: Big!<br />
Swim around in it, through it&mdash;<br />
all directions and find<br />
vitreous seawater stuff&mdash;<br />
God how I love you!&mdash;or, as I say,<br />
a plunge into the ditch. The end. I sit<br />
examining my red handful. Balancing<br />
&mdash;this&mdash;in and out&mdash;agh.<br />
<br />
Love you? It&#8217;s<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>a fire in the blood, willy-nilly!<br />

Ha, but it&#8217;s the grey moon too, already up<br />
in the morning. You are slow.<br />
Men are not friends where it concerns<br />
a woman? Fighters. Playfellows.<br />
White round thighs! Youth! Sighs&mdash;!<br />
It&#8217;s the fillip of novelty. It&#8217;s&mdash;<br />
<br />
Mountains. Elephants humping along<br />
against the sky&mdash;indifferent to<br />
light withdrawing its tattered shreds,<br />
worn out with embraces. It&#8217;s<br />
the fillip of novelty. It&#8217;s a fire in the blood.<br />
<br />
Oh get a flannel shirt, white flannel<br />
or pongee. You&#8217;d look so well!<br />
I married you because I liked your nose.<br />
I wanted you! I wanted you<br />
in spite of all they&#8217;d say&mdash;<br />
<br />
Rain and light, mountain and rain,<br />
rain and river. Will you love me always?<br />

burning, seething&mdash;No, no, no.<br />
The birches are opening their leaves one<br />
by one. Their delicate leaves unfold cold<br />
and separate, one by one. Slender tassels<br />
hang swaying from the delicate branch tips&mdash;<br />
Oh, I cannot say it. There is no word.<br />
Black is split at once into flowers. In<br />
every bog and ditch, flares of<br />
small fire, white flowers!&mdash;Agh,<br />
the birches are mad, mad with their green.<br />
The world is gone, torn into shreds<br />

O my brother, you redfaced, living man<br />
ignorant, stupid whose feet are upon<br />
this same dirt that I touch&mdash;and eat.<br />
We are alone in this terror, alone,<br />
face to face on this road, you and I,<br />
wrapped by this flame!<br />
Let the polished plows stay idle,<br />
their gloss already on the black soil.<br />
But that face of yours&mdash;!<br />
Answer me. I will clutch you. I<br />
will hug you, grip you. I will poke my face<br />
into your face and force you to see me.<br />
Take me in your arms, tell me the commonest<br />
thing that is in your mind to say,<br />

Every familiar object is changed and dwarfed.<br />

that splits comfort, blows apart<br />
my careful partitions, crushes my house<br />

and startled, empty eyes&mdash;peering out<br />
into a cold world.<br />

In the spring I would drink! In the spring<br />
I would be drunk and lie forgetting all things.<br />
Your face! Give me your face, Yang Kue Fei!<br />
your hands, your lips to drink!<br />
Give me your wrists to drink&mdash;<br />
I drag you, I am drowned in you, you<br />
overwhelm me! Drink!<br />
Save me! The shad bush is in the edge<br />
of the clearing. The yards in a fury<br />
of lilac blossoms are driving me mad with terror.<br />
Drink and lie forgetting the world.<br />
<br />
And coldly the birch leaves are opening one by one.<br />
Coldly I observe them and wait for the end.<br />
And it ends.</td></tr></table>
